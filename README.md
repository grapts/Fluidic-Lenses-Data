# Fluidic-Lenses-with-High-Dioptric-Power
We report a complete theoretical model and supporting experimental results on
the fabrication and characterization of macroscopic adaptive fluidic lenses with high dioptric
power, tunable focal distance, and aperture shape. The lens is 17 mm wide and is made of an
elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer, which can adaptively restore accommodation
distance within several cm according to the fluidic volume mechanically pumped in. Moreover,
the lens can provide for magnification in the range of +25 diopter to +100 diopter with optical
aberrations within a fraction of a wavelength, and overall lens weight of less than 2 g. The
agreement between the non-linear theoretical model describing the elastic membrane deformation
and the experimental results is apparent. We stress that these features make the proposed lenses
appropriate for the low vision segment, as well as for applications in video magnifiers, camera
zooms, telescope and microscopes objectives, and other machine vision applications where large
magnification is required.
